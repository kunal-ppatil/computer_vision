# computer_vision
This repository contains Computer Vision projects demonstrating the application of image and video processing, object detection, and analysis using Python and OpenCV. The projects cover both traditional computer vision techniques and, optionally, deep learning-based approaches.

##Current Projects

1.Weapon Detection:
Detects guns in live video feeds using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers. Highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and logs detections.

##Features

1.Real-time video capture and processing
2.Object detection using Haar cascades or deep learning models
3.Image preprocessing: resizing, grayscale conversion, and filtering
4.Visualizing detection results on video frames
5.Optional: analytics on detection events (for future extensions)

##Tech Stack

Python: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, imutils

Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch, YOLO, or custom CNN models

Visualization: Matplotlib, OpenCV display windows

##Purpose
This repository is a portfolio of hands-on computer vision projects demonstrating practical skills in:
1.Image and video processing
2.Object detection and tracking
3.Real-time computer vision applications
