# computer_vision
This repository contains Computer Vision projects demonstrating the application of image and video processing, object detection, and analysis using Python and OpenCV. The projects cover both traditional computer vision techniques and, optionally, deep learning-based approaches.
Current Projects

Weapon Detection: Detects guns in live video feeds using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers. Highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and logs detections.

(Add future projects here, e.g., face recognition, object tracking, image segmentation)

Features

Real-time video capture and processing

Object detection using Haar cascades or deep learning models

Image preprocessing: resizing, grayscale conversion, and filtering

Visualizing detection results on video frames

Optional: analytics on detection events (for future extensions)

Tech Stack

Python: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, imutils

Optional Deep Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch, YOLO, or custom CNN models

Visualization: Matplotlib, OpenCV display windows

Purpose

This repository is a portfolio of hands-on computer vision projects demonstrating practical skills in:

Image and video processing

Object detection and tracking

Real-time computer vision applications
