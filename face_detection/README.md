##Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system using Python and OpenCV. It detects objects (faces in the current setup) from a webcam feed or a video file and highlights them with bounding boxes. The system uses Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection and can be extended to detect other objects with custom models.

##Features
1.Real-time face detection from webcam or video files
2.Bounding boxes around detected faces
3.Easy to run on local Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts
4.Extendable to deep learning-based detection models like YOLO

##Requirements
1.Python 3.x
2.OpenCV
